        <h1>Everyday Pancakes</h1>
        <img src="../img/pancake.jpg" alt="Delicious Pancakes with Honey">
<p>The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and baking powder for leavening. You can use different types of flour if you want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat.</p><p>And you can also add fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the same time it takes to make toast. The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking them.</p><p>But that time is so short you should consider these an everyday convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook this recipe a few times and it may become part of your weekly routine.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<strong>Yield: 4 to 6 servings</strong>
<ul>
    <li>2
        cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2
            teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼
                teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2
                    eggs</li>
                    <li>1½ to cups milk</li>
                    <li>2
                        tablespoons melted and cooled butter <p>optional), plus unmelted butter for cooking,</p> or use neutral oil</li>
                        <p></p>
 <h2>Preparation</h2>
 <ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix together dry</p><p>ingredients. Beat eggs into 1½ cups milk, then stir in 2 tablespoons melted cooled</p>
        <p>butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture into dry ingredients, mixing only</p>
        <p>enough to moisten flour; don't worry about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.</p></li>
    <li><strong>step 2</strong><p>Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When butter foam</p><p>subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or skillet, making pancakes of</p><p>any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary; usually, first batch will require higher</p><p>heat than subsequent batches. Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and</p><p>bottoms brown, after 2 to 4 minutes.</p></li> 
    <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an ovenproof plate in</p><p>a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.</p></li>
