<p>Come, my child…come. I shall take you by the hand and take you where you need to go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shall show you the food that is solely responsible for my bones and tissues multiplying and growing at a young age.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s macaroni and cheese. And it’s the only pasta (or food) I consumed until I was about fourteen years old.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>Come…come, my child.<b> I shall show you the way.</b></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 c. dried macaroni</li>
    <li>1 whole egg</li>
    <li>1/4 c. (1/2 stick or 4 tablespoons) salted butter
    </li>
    <li>1/4 c. all-purpose flour
    </li>
    <li>2 1/2 c. whole milk
    </li>
    <li>2 tsp. (heaping) dry mustard, more if desired
    </li>
    <li>1 lb. cheese (such as cheddar, jack and/or fontina), grated
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the macaroni until very firm. The macaroni <p>should be too firm to eat right </p> of the pot. Drain.</li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg.</li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <li>In a large pot, melt the butter and sprinkle in the flour. Whisk together over medium-low <p>heat. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes, whisking</p>constantly. Don’t let it burn. Pour in the milk,<p>add the mustard, and whisk until smooth. Cook for 5 </p>minutes until very thick. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
<li>Take 1/4 cup of the sauce and slowly pour it into the beaten egg, whisking constantly to avoid cooking the egg. Whisk together till smooth.</li>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<li>Pour the egg mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly. Stir until smooth. Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add the salt, seasoned salt and<p>pepper. Taste the sauce and add more salt and seasoned salt as needed! 
 <b>DO NOT UNDERSALT.</b> </p><p>Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir to combine. Serve immediately (very creamy) or pour into a buttered baking dish, </p>top with extra cheese, and bake at 350˚ for 20 to 25 minutes, or until bubbly and golden on top.</li>
</ol>
